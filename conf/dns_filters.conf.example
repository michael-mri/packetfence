# DNS filter configuration
#
# you can trigger rule in pfdns on specific scope (registration, isolation, inline, dnsenforcement)
#
# Make a simple rule like this:
#
# [packetfence]
# filter = qname
# operator = is
# value = www.packetfence.org
#
# [1:packetfence]
# scope = registration
# answer = 30 IN A 10.0.0.1
# rcode = NOERROR
#
# It means that when pfdns receive a dns request for the dns name www.packetfence.org then it will answer the ip 10.0.0.1
# see http://search.cpan.org/~nlnetlabs/Net-DNS-0.74/lib/Net/DNS/RR.pm for more details
#
#
#
#
# filter can be:
#
#     qname
#     qclass
#     qtype
#     peerhost
#     query ( http://search.cpan.org/~nlnetlabs/Net-DNS-1.04/lib/Net/DNS/Packet.pm )
#     conn.peerhost
#     conn.sockport
#     conn.sockhost
#     conn.peerport
#     time
#
# operator can be:
#     is
#     is_not
#     match
#     match_not
#     defined
#     not_defined
#     regex
#     date_is_before
#     date_is_after
#
# value can be:
#
# - for qname the fqdn search (www.packetfence.org)
#
# - for qclass
#    IN              1 the Internet
#    CS              2 the CSNET class (Obsolete - used only for examples in some obsolete RFCs)
#    CH              3 the CHAOS class
#    HS              4 Hesiod [Dyer 87]
#
# - for qtype
#    A               1 a host address
#    NS              2 an authoritative name server
#    CNAME           5 the canonical name for an alias
#    SOA             6 marks the start of a zone of authority
#    WKS             11 a well known service description
#    PTR             12 a domain name pointer
#    HINFO           13 host information
#    MINFO           14 mailbox or mail list information
#    MX              15 mail exchange
#    TXT             16 text strings
#
# - for peerhost the ip addess of the client
#
# - for query the value in the representation of a Net::DNS::Packet packet
#
# - for conn
#    ip or port
#
# The value of a time is specific and follow this logic:
# http://search.cpan.org/~pryan/Period-1.20/Period.pm
# For example, if you want to allow access from Monday to Friday, 9am to 11am and from 2pm to 4pm:
# wd {Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri} hr {9am-11am}, wd {Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri} hr {2pm-4am}
#
# answer is in the format of http://search.cpan.org/~nlnetlabs/Net-DNS-1.04/lib/Net/DNS/RR.pm
#
# rcode can be:
#    NOERROR   No Error
#    FORMERR   Format Error
#    SERVFAIL  Server Failure
#    NXDOMAIN  Non-Existent Domain
#    NOTIMP    Not Implemented
#    REFUSED   Query Refused
#    YXDOMAIN  Name Exists when it should not
#    YXRRSET   RR Set Exists when it should not
#    NXRRSET   RR Set that should exist does not
#    NOTAUTH   Server Not Authoritative for zone
#    NOTAUTH   Not Authorized
#    NOTZONE   Name not contained in zone
#    BADVERS   Bad OPT Version
